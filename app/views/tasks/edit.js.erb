// I had to create this file


// This line of code renders the form partial into an String of HTML,
// then encodes that HTML String into a JavaScript String.
$('.modal-body').html("<%= j render 'form', task: @task %>");

// This line is the jQuery code necessary to launch the Bootstrap popup into the middle of the page.
$('.modal').modal();


// So to summarize, line 1 populates the popup body, and line 2 launches the popup.
